# Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be
# validated according to the following rules:
# 
# 
# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without
# repetition.
# 
# 
# 
# A partially filled sudoku which is valid.
# 
# The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with
# the character '.'.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [
# ⁠ ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
# ⁠ ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
# ⁠ [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
# ⁠ ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
# ⁠ ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
# ⁠ ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
# ⁠ [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
# ⁠ [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
# ⁠ [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
# ]
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [
# ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
# ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
# [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
# ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
# ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
# ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
# [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
# [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
# [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
# ]
# Output: false
# Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner
# being 
# ⁠   modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is
# invalid.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily
# solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned
# rules.
# The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
# The given board size is always 9x9.
#
