#
# Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
# (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)  You
# may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# 
# Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the same
# as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or
# reflected) to equal the other.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 11000
# 11000
# 00011
# 00011
# 
# Given the above grid map, return 1.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 11011
# 10000
# 00001
# 11011
# Given the above grid map, return 3.
# Notice that:
# 
# 11
# 1
# 
# and
# 
# ‚Å†1
# 11
# 
# are considered different island shapes, because we do not consider reflection
# / rotation.
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
