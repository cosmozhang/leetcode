# Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what
# matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one
# square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but
# you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.
# 
# ‚Å†Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their
# stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether
# you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl
# has.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
# Output: true
# 
# Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came
# two sticks with length 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
# Output: false
# 
# Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the
# matchsticks.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
# The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed 15.
