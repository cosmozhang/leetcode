# Testcase Example:  '[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]\n0'
#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).
# 
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true,
# otherwise return false.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: false
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may
# contain duplicates.
# Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
#
